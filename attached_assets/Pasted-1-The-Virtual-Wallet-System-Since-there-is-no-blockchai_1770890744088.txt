1. The "Virtual Wallet" System
Since there is no blockchain, you need a secure way to track every cent.

The Ledger: Tell the Agent: "Create a Wallet table in the database. Every user has a balance column. Never update this balance without creating a TransactionHistory entry (Deposit, Withdrawal, Purchase)."

Balance Lock: "When a user lists a card for sale, or enters a paid tournament, the funds should move to a 'Pending' or 'Escrow' state so they can't spend the same money twice."

2. Cash Deposit Flow (Payment Gateway)
Since you are on Replit, you can't handle credit cards directly (for security).

Integration: Tell the Agent: "Integrate the Stripe API or PayPal SDK for deposits. When a 'Successful Payment' webhook is received, increment the user's digital balance."

Deposit Logs: "Store the 'Transaction ID' from the bank so we can track any failed deposits."

3. The Cash-Out (Withdrawal) Logic
This is the most sensitive part. You need an "Admin Review" step to prevent fraud.

Withdrawal Request: "Create a 'WithdrawalRequest' system. A user enters their bank details (IBAN/SWIFT) and the amount. The digital funds are immediately deducted and marked as 'Processing'."

Admin Dashboard: "Build an Admin page for me where I can see all pending withdrawals. I will manually send the bank transfer and click 'Mark as Complete' in the dashboard to archive the request."

4. Sorare-Style Gameplay without Crypto
To keep the "Premium" feel without NFTs:

The Marketplace: Instead of "Buying an NFT," the user is "Buying a Database Record." Tell the Agent: "The Marketplace should allow User A to sell a player card to User B. The system must automatically deduct the digital cash from B and give it to A, minus a small 'Marketplace Fee' for the platform."

Card Serial Numbers: Since you aren't on a blockchain, you are the "Source of Truth." Tell the Agent: "Assign a unique SerialID to every card when it's generated (e.g., Haaland #001). This ID never changes, even when the card is sold to a new user."
