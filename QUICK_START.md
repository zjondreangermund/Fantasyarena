## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Blueprint not found"
1. Make sure you pushed the latest code to GitHub
2. Refresh your GitHub connection in Render
3. Try Manual Setup instead (see RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md)

### Build fails
1. Check Render logs for error details
2. Ensure you have `render.yaml` in your repository
3. See full troubleshooting in RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md

### Database won't initialize
1. Make sure deployment finished completely
2. Wait 1-2 minutes after deploy completes
3. Try running `npm run db:push` again

### Site is slow
- **First load after sleep**: 20-30 seconds (normal on free tier)
- **After that**: Fast!
