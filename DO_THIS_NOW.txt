========================================
     STOP READING DOCUMENTATION
        DO ONE OF THESE TWO THINGS
========================================

OPTION 1 (EASIEST - 2 MINUTES):
  1. Open Netlify Dashboard
  2. Go to Site Settings > Build & deploy
  3. Change Production branch to: copilot/set-up-railway-deployment
  4. Click Save
  5. Click "Trigger deploy"
  
  DONE. Your site will build successfully.

========================================

OPTION 2 (PERMANENT - 5 MINUTES):
  1. Open GitHub
  2. Go to your repository
  3. Click "Pull requests"
  4. Click "New pull request"
  5. Set: main ← copilot/set-up-railway-deployment
  6. Click "Create pull request"
  7. Click "Merge pull request"
  
  DONE. Netlify will auto-deploy from main.

========================================

WHY ISN'T IT WORKING?
  - All fixes are on copilot/set-up-railway-deployment branch
  - Netlify is building from main branch
  - Main branch doesn't have the fixes
  - That's it. That's the only problem.

========================================

IGNORE ALL OTHER DOCUMENTATION.
JUST DO ONE OF THE TWO OPTIONS ABOVE.
========================================
